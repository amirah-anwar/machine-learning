The file "hmm-data.txt" contains a map of a 10-by-10 2D grid-world. The row and
column indices start from 0. The free cells are represented as '1's and the obstacles are represented as
'0's. There are four towers, one in each of the four corners, as indicated in the data file. Your task is to
use a Hidden Markov Model to figure out the most likely trajectory of a robot in this grid-world.
Assume that the initial position of the robot has a uniform prior over all free cells. In each time-step,
the robot moves to one of its neighboring free cells chosen uniformly at random. At a given cell, the
robot measures L2-distances to each of the towers. For a true distance d, the robot records a noisy
measurement chosen uniformly at random from the interval [0.7d, 1.3d]. These measurements for 11
time-steps are also provided in the data file.
